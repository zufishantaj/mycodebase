            <p class="font-italic">I still remember, the night was deep and quiet and we were connected through whatsapp, enjoying the chats which had something magical hidden for us. 
              Last year, on this very night <b>August 17, 2019</b> it started again. Wait..again? Nah, the spark was always there; but we both kept it to ourselves thinking the other was happy but both were wrong.
              It is a story involving a young, intelligent and confident guy '<b>Obaid</b>', aka Honey who dreams of being a best family man, fulfilling all of his responsibilities and duties sincerely from a very young age. A very good man by heart, generous and compassionate, willing to do anything for his friends and families.
              He dreams big and works hard to achieve his goals everyday. Now, here comes the heroine of our story '<b>Zufishan</b>', oh wait 'Zoofie-the tiktoker'. You can laugh as of now but let me tell you this is really annoying. Haan, so let's continue..
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="font-italic">Zoofie, a girl who is compassionate, funny, confused, the kind that deserves to have her life filled with love and memorable moments. The one who fails in expressing her emotions, who laughs fully and cry on little things, who is empathetic and wants to know if people are doing okay. 
            Most important a crazy girl who lives in her own magical world dreaming of her lovestory to be the best one. These SRK fan, bollywood.. ahhhhhhh so irritating for you na? But let me tell you, her lovestory is the best one. No infact the <b>bestest</b> one.</p>
