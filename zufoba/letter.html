            <p class="font-italic">My Love,</p>
            <p class="font-italic">Since I'm very bad at expressing my love for you and always fail on your expectation but today as it's been a year, I really want to tell you that it was an amazing journey with you by my side.
              I love you more than you could imagine.You're the best partner one could ever get.
                            You're my best friend and my greatest blessing.</p>
            <p class="font-italic">From the moment we are together, I know there were lots of ups and downs in our relationship, but the good thing is we made it through and always will.. In Sha Allah!
              Every word you say, means a lot to me. For me, you're my true love. I've loved you always jabse I fell for you till now and will forever love you with all my heart.
              I want to spend rest of my life with you and do all those silly things I have always dreamt of doing it with you. I want to kiss you, love you and also baal bhi nochna hai..hehe :D
              I assure you it would be a roller coaster ride together. Also, I will try to meet your expectation. I know I'm far behind it but I will definitely put all my effort to reach there.
              My happiness, sadness everything is with you. I always keep you safe in my prayers.</p>
            <p class="font-italic">You're the most generous, kind hearted and caring soul I have ever known, and I am so grateful to call you mine.</p>
            <p class="font-italic">All my love,</p>
